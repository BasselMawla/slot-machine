# Slot Machine PixiJS Demo

A slot machine game demo using PixiJS on top of plain JavaScript.
The demo was coded in an object-oriented style with classes inherting from PixiJS classes.

Howler.js, a simple yet reliable audio library, was used for sound effects.

## Instructions:
Requires coregaming/simple-slot-api to be running at http://localhost:8888.  
The application can then be run by hosting it locally like any PixiJS application.
